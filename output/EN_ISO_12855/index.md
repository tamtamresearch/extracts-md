## Introduction

This technical standard (hereinafter also referred to as the “described document”) specifies the interface for the exchange of data messages between the main entities (roles) of the electronic fee collection system architecture, i.e., the toll charger and the toll service provider. It establishes the complete specification of data messages, their syntax, semantics, and the mechanism of their transmission.

Note: This Extract presents selected chapters of the described document and retains the original chapter numbering.

## Usage

The described document is intended for toll chargers and toll service providers, as it establishes the basic elements of mutual interoperability at the level of their back-end systems.

## Scope

The described document defines the exchange of information between the toll charger and the toll service provider. It describes the interface functionality, as well as the complete syntax and semantics of the data messages that can be exchanged via the interface (especially trusted objects, context data, exception lists, toll declarations, billing details, enforcement data). Furthermore, transmission mechanisms and support functions are described here.
